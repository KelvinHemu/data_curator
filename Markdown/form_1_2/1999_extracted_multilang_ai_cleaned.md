## SECTION B

Read the following passage carefully and then answer the questions that follow.

A great part of Tanzania has fertile land and gets sufficient rain. Our country can produce various crops for home consumption and for export. We can produce such food crops as maize, rice, wheat, beans, cassava, sorghum, sweet potatoes and groundnuts as well as cash crops such as sisal, cotton, coffee, tobacco, pyrethrum and tea. If we produce those crops in large quantities we can export them.

Our Land is also good for grazing cattle, goats, sheep and for raising chicken. We can also get plenty of fish from our lakes, rivers and from the sea. All our farmers are in areas which can produce two or three or even more of the food and cash crops mentioned above. Each farmer could increase his or her production so as to get more food and more money. And because the main aim of development is to be able to get enough food and more money for our other needs, we must aim at increasing our production of those agricultural crops. In fact it is the surest way to develop our country. Through increased agricultural production, every Tanzanian will be able to obtain enough food and money to meet his or her needs.
