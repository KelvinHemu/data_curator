~ Read the following poem and-answer the questions.
If we must die let it not be like dogs

So that our precious blood may not be shed
In vain, then the monsters we defy.

Read the following story and answer the questions.
Delores came to school on crutches one day. She had sprained her ankle. Her ankle was all wrapped up, and she said it hurt. The doctor had told her that she would have to use the crutches until her ankle was better.
Our teacher taught us all about sprains. She showed us pictures and charts. We took turns wrapping each other's ankles.

Delores got lots of attention. Every day, the teacher asked, ‘How’.
your leg today, Delores?” The principal stopped by to sce her. The nurse came by too. We helped Delores with her books and her lunch.
After a while, we got tired of all the attention Delores was getting,
We made fun of her. We imitated the way she had to walk. We teaseq her when she couldn't play with us.
One day, we talked Delores into Ictling us try out her crutches,
She didn’t really want to. We took the crulched and went all around the playground. We walked on the sidewalks and the grass. We even walked up the steps.
Walking with crutches was a lot harder than we thought it would be. And they really hurt our arms! We gladly gave the crutches back to
Delores. We were sorry we had teased her.
We learned two good lessons today. We learned that it is wrong to make fun of people. We also learned that things are not always as much fun as they seem. We all told Delores that we were sorry. And she told us that she will gladly give the crutches back soon!
