My name is Nianjema, | had not travelled to Mwanza before, MY sister, Ananijali Laa her house in Mwanza so that | could see the rocks. My mother told me to be polite to my sis urmey his husband during my stay with them. I was so excited and 1 told my friends about the Journey,
My sister told me that my brother-in-law will come to pick me Over the weekend.
It was Saturday evening, when my brother-in-law arrived at our place. He told me that, ae travel by bus as it was faster than the train and cheaper than the plane. On Sunday We og tickets at the booking office in Dares Salaam and we managed to board the bus at 8:00 i :
conductor was very respectful and polite in attending his passengers. When we reached Dodoma,
heard a screech of tyres and the bus started to move tn a zigzag manner and finally stopped.
Most of the passengers were screaming and | did the same. My brother in-law who was concemed with my safety held my hands and urged me to stop panicking. He told me that it was only a tyre bust and there was no more danger. The bus was moving at the speed of 80 kilometres per hour
We were all grateful to the driver, Mr. Ntoi, because if he was moving with the high speed than that; we could haye been involved in a very bad accident.
We all got out of the bus and the tyre was changed before we continued with our journey. We then stopped to refuel at Manyoni Kobil fuel station. The pump attendant looked up and saw me looking at him. He smiled at me and I smiled back. He told me that, I will be enjoying very much to see the wonders in the Rock City where rocks are settled as if they are going to fall. He finally told me to bring him some fish on my way back. What he told me stimulated me a lot and | could not wait to get to Mwanza to see the rocks and tell my sister about the journey.
