## SECTION A (20 Marks)

**COMPREHENSION AND SUMMARY**
Read the passage below carefully and then answer the guestions that follow.
HIV lives in the body fluid of an infected person. The virus is spread when these fluids get into the body of another person. This means that HIV is transmitted through having sexual intercourse with an infected person, using unsterilized surgical instruments such as knives, razorblades and syringes.
HIV is not spread from one person to another by touching, shaking hands, sitting together or eating together.
However, one can protect himself/herself from HIV infection by avoiding unprotected sex and the use of contaminated syringes, knives or razorblades.
Some people who are living with HIV/AIDS are afraid of death or live regrettably about how they got HIV/AIDS. The best thing to do for a person with AIDS is to spend time with his/her family and feel that he/she is just like other people who are not infected.
The patient should drink extra fluid and eat balanced diet. The patient should be discouraged from taking alcohol or smoking cigarettes. In addition, the sick should not share toothbrush, razorblades or syringes with others. If the care taker wants to wash the patient, he/she should make sure that he/she wears protective gloves so as to avoid infection.
