4. Read the following passage carefully and then answer the questions that follow.
The judiciary is the branch of the government that interprets the law and provides justice to citizens. It does this through its courts. These ensure that laws are obeyed. They also settle disputes between the different branches of government. Courts are final decision makers in interpreting the constitution. This is why the judiciary must be independent from the executive and the legislature. For the same reason. the courts have the power of judicial review. This means the power to declare as wrong any law or action by the executive or legislature which contradicts with the national constitution.
An ea judiciary is the one where judges can make decision without fear of being k ae lized "the executive. If the president could have powers to dismiss any judge who makes d ons which do not please him, then the judiciary will not be independent.
