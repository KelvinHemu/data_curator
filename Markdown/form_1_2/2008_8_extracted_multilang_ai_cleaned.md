**COMPREHENSION AND SUMMARY**

1. Read the following passage carefully then answer all the questions which follow.

Dear Cindy,

Auntie Miriam has asked me to write to you. As your mother, she wants to do her best for you but at the moment you don’t want to talk to her, and she understands that. Probably you haven’t spoken to anyone yet, have you?

Anyway, auntie has asked me to tell you my story. You know that I am HIV positive too, don’t you? I was 15 when I met a boy who was new in town — William. He was great. We fell in love and he asked me to have sex with him. He seemed so nice and he didn’t force me or threaten me. When he told me I was the first one I believed him! When he also said we didn’t need to use a condom, I agreed. Anyway, I was with him for about a year before I caught him with another girl and broke up with him.

I was busy with my school certificate and had no time for other boys, but I started being ill with stomach aches and fevers. Mother took me to the hospital and they took some tests. When we got the results it was terrible! Father shouted at me, mother cried. As for me, I just wanted to be alone. I kept asking myself how I could be so stupid. Me, who was first in my class in so many subjects and who was going to be the first member of the family to go to university! Why did I believe William? I wrote him a letter and told him what had happened, but he never replied.

Now the only thing I had to look forward to was terrible illness. We had two horrible months of family arguments and tears. Then a health worker came to see us. She was about 20 years old and even made jokes. She told me that HIV is not AIDS, that if you look after yourself, you can delay AIDS for many years. She told me to eat a healthy diet-not too much fat and sugar, plenty of vegetables and exercise and to get plenty of rest. If I start to get very ill, I can go to the hospital to get some anti-retroviral drugs from the clinic, which will keep me well. She told me there was a support group at the hospital, where they get together with other HIV positive students in town.
