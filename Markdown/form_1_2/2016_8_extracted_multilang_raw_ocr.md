Read the following passage carefully and then answer the questions that follow
Gender refers to differences in social roles and relations between males and females. Gender roles are learned through socialization and very widely within and between cultures. Gender discrimination refers to unequal treatment between males and females whereby one gender is given more priority in different opportunities.
Some of the customs which lead to gender discrimination in our societies include food taboos
These are the practices of restricting a certain group 01 people from eating certain types ol food
For example, some Tanzanian socicties do not allow pregnant women to eat eggs or fish
Another custom that lead to gender discrimination is the discrimination of women and children in decision making. Women and children are discriminated even in issues that concern their lives for example marriage and property ownership. Young girls have been forced to be marned while widows are forced to marry brothers of their deceased husbands
Questions
(a) Suggest a suitable title for this passage
(b) According to the passage, what is gender discrimination?
