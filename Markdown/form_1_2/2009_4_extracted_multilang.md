Candidate’s Examination NO. .....................

**SECTION B (50 MARKS)**
Read the following passage carefully and then answer the questions that follow:
The number of children who are seen loitering in cities and towns increases day by day. Between
1960 and 1970, very few of these were seen in Tanzania. However, from 1970 up to now their number has greatly increased.
One of the reasons could be the death of parents or guardians. The cause of death nowadays could be HIV/AIDS. Due to ignorance, some relative refuse to live with orphans for fear that they will be infected with the disease. Other relatives are not willing to add extra children to their families and see them as a burden. There are also relatives who are irresponsible. The unfortunate children therefore, end up in streets.
Another reason for street children is that some parents are very strict or cruel. They punish their children severely for even slight mistakes. In order to escape this kind of torture and brutality, the abused children run away.
Separation or divorce of parents due to drunkenness, harassment or other misunderstandings may be another reason for Street children. The children do not get parental love and care and may decide not to stay with either of the parents.
Lack of enough knowledge on family planning could also contribute to having street children. As the family keeps on growing, parents fail to sustain their children. Such children miss their basic necessities and decide to go to the streets to find them.
QUESTIONS
(a) Suggest a suitable title for this passage.
(b) Write down three causes for street children.
(c) Give two reasons why do parents separate.
(d) Explain briefly why some relatives refuse to live with orphans whose parents died of
HIV/AIDS.
