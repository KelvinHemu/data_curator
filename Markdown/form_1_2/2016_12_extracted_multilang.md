## SECTION A

**COMPREHENSION AND SUMMARY (15 MARKS)**
Read the passage below carefully and then answer the questions that follow.
I had a friend at school who was always complaining to be sick. His name was Isaya. He used to come to school in the morning and tell us that, “I am not very well today”. At first, we were all sympathetic to him and our class teacher often used to send him back home to his parents for treatment.
Funny enough when he was sent home for treatment, he normally plays with street children instead of going straight home to his parents. After the first term, his fellow students started to ignore his complaints. The boy was too lazy to do anything, whenever given an assignment to do he had a lot of excuses. One day the teacher on duty Mr. Matola asked all of us in our class to clean the assembly ground, but Isaya said that, “I cannot do the cleanliness because I am sick”.
Everybody started shouting, “No, he is lying, he is not sick”. The class teacher, madam Asante and the teacher on duty, Mr. Matola heard the noise and rushed in our classroom. Isaya decided to jump through the window in order to run away from the teachers. To the unfortunately, he could not make it, as he fell down and broke his left leg.
Esaya was crying bitterly on the ground. Everyone was afraid of telling the truth to the teachers,
because teachers were not aware of Isaya’s deceitful behaviour. The teachers, asked “Why was
Isaya running”, then the class monitor said, “We are so sorry, because we had never revealed
Isaya’s bad behaviour to you. Isaya is a liar he is not sick, but he always says that he is sick, we are tired of all his lies that is why we were shouting and he wanted to escape”. All teachers were surprised to hear that story. Then Isaya was sent to the hospital and his parents were informed that
Isaya was expelled from school for three months.

Sports and games are necessary for maintaining health and physical fitness. Involving oneself in competitive sports and games encourages the sense of competition. Being a captain helps to provide the person with leadership qualities. Playing as a team encourages cooperation among players.
You may ask yourself, “If I spend my time in sports and games when should I study?” Here is the solution; study in the morning as the mind is still fresh and play in the evening as the mind is tired since sports and games make us mentally active.

Life on the street
Is the rotten meat
Becoming worse and worse
Every day
You think it is okay
Because you are far away
When you don't know
The way of our life
You give us some money
But like bees and honey
We are addicted to glue
The drug that keeps us here
I wonder if I will be alive
When I reach the age of ten
But having lived here all my life
I suppose I'll have to try
