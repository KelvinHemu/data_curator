## SECTION A: (20 Marks)

**COMPREHENSION**
Answer ALL questions in this section

1. Read the following passage and answer the questions.

Many people think that eating food is simply something which is pleasant and necessary to satisfy hunger. They do not realize that a great deal of their ill health is due to eating the wrong kind of food. The reason for this is that, they do not know enough about what food is for.

In many parts of the world, notably in certain Asian countries, there is much starvation and many people die each year because they eat insufficient food. In these countries, the main problem is the low production of food. In East Africa, however, starvation and prolonged hunger are not as common as in Asia, because in most areas the climate and soil allow the people living there to produce enough food for their needs. A person belonging to a family in which hunger is unknown, finds it is difficult to realize that some of his relatives may be ill because of something lacking in their diet. But food is necessary not only to satisfy hunger, but also to provide the body with certain substances to keep it healthy. Ill health due to a poor diet is known as malnutrition. In East Africa malnutrition is not caused by lack of food, but due to lack of knowledge about food. The solution to the problem lies in the spreading of this knowledge.

It is important for people to realize that malnutrition causes a great deal of illness and death. Moreover, apart from the people who are obviously ill, there are many thousands who are tired or weak, or have poorly developed bodies, simply through lack of proper feeding. These people are far more likely to get common diseases such as tuberculosis, infections and diarrhea than those with a good diet. These people do not recover from the diseases so quickly.

It is extraordinary that many people are unaware of the serious problem of malnutrition in their own country. Many people are surprised, while they see a case, or a photograph of a case of common nutritional disease, kwashiorkor, saying that they never realized that it exists or how horrible it is. Malnutrition is the most common and severe in children under five years of age, and women of child — bearing age. It has been going on for years and is likely to become more wide spread as more people go to live in big towns and cease to grow their own food.

People tend to think that the problem of malnutrition is something for doctors or the Ministry of Health to solve. It is true that medical staffs are necessary to cure diseases due to malnutrition, but the solution is not to cure but prevention.
