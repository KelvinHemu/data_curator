## SECTION A

**COMPREHENSION AND SUMMARY (25 MARKS)**
Read the following passage carefully and answer the guestions that follow.
My name is Jane. I have a friend called Tunu. We study at the same school. Yesterday evening
Tunu and I left for home together. On the way we found two big dogs fighting. We stopped and watched the fight for a while. Suddenly, one of the dogs started running towards us. It looked very angry and we thought it would bite us. Therefore, we started running. Tunu ran faster than me. She reached the main road before me and as she tried to cross it, a lorry that was moving very fast knocked her down. “Poor Tunu!” I exclaimed instantly.
Indeed, it was a very bad accident because she was injured badly. I didn’t know what to do because Tunu lay there bleeding and unconscious. I started screaming so that people could come and help me. A few minutes later, people gathered at the spot. One of them was a traffic police officer — Mr. Mwakasungule. He looked at her for a minute or so and then ordered two men to rush her to hospital. Then, he asked me to go home and tell her parents about the accident.
This accident reminded me of my uncle who was involved in an accident last year. In that accident he was among the few survivors. “Glory be to God”.

Read the passage given below and list down five ways in which women are denied their rights.
In many developing societies, people tend to undermine one sex group, that is, women. Some societies undermine women by not giving them the right of contributing ideas in the society. In such societies, women are not given equal access to formal education as men. In fact, men are given the first priority in almost every aspect of life — they are decision makers, rulers and owners of the means of production.
Women are not given the right to:
