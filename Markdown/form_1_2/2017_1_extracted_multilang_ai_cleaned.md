(b) Factorize the expression $6x^2 - 11x + 4$ by splitting the middle term.

**6.** (a) Find the equation of the straight line passing through the points (3, 5) and (7, 9). (Express your answer in the form y = mx + c).

(b) The vertices of a triangle are A (2, 2), B (3, 4), and C (4, 3). If the triangle is reflected in the y-axis, write down the coordinates of the image of points A, B, and C.

(b) Without using mathematical tables, find the exact value of $\frac{\tan 45^\circ + \tan 30^\circ}{1 - \tan 45^\circ \tan 30^\circ}$.

**10.** (a) In a primary school of 150 pupils, 50 study Hisabati, 70 study Sayansi, and 40 study both subjects. By using the appropriate formula, calculate the number of pupils who study neither Hisabati nor Sayansi.

(b) The marks of 61 students are represented in the following table:

| Mark | Number of students |
