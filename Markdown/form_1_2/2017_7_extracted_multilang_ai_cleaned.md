    Diagram

    b) You are required to demonstrate one of the chemical properties of Oxygen. You are provided with four gas jars of oxygen and four pieces of elements named (A, B, C and D), they are Sodium, Magnesium, Carbon and Sulphur.

    Procedure:

    The elements are placed in deflagrating spoon and inserted in the gas jars of oxygen one after the other.

    Observation:

    Element A + Oxygen → it burns with a bright white flame leaving a white powder.

    Element B + Oxygen → it burns vigorously with a yellow flame leaving a pale yellow solid.

    Element C + Oxygen → it melts and burns with a blue flame giving a misty (white gas)

    Element D + Oxygen → it burns slowly with yellowish white flame giving a colourless gas.

    i) Identify the elements A, B, C and D.

    ii) Name the products formed after the elements A, B, C and D burned in Oxygen.

    iii) Classify the elements A, B, C and D into metals and non-metals.
