1.  (a) A block is cut into equal units of 10 g, 20 g and 35 g. Use prime factor method to find the smallest possible mass of the block from which the pieces can be cut.

2.  (a) Subtract:

    ```
    m   dm  cm  mm
    10  9   31  2
    -8  9   38  9
    ```

    (b) Find the simple interest on sh. 10,000,000 invested for 5 years at the rate of 6% per annum.

3.  (a) Calculate the size of angle *x* and *y* in the following figure:

    *(Figure missing)*

4.  (a) Solve by the elimination method:

    *(Equation missing)*

    (b) Solve the equation 4( *p* + 1) - *p* = 3.

5.  (a) If the slope of the straight line through the points (7, 4) and (-2, *k*) is 1, find the value of *k*.

    (b) By using a sketch, find the image of the point A(5, 2) under a reflection in the line *y* = 0, followed by another reflection in the line *y* = *x*.

6.  (a) Use laws of exponents to simplify:

    (2*x*<sup>2</sup>) / ( *x*<sup>2</sup>)

    (b) If log2 = 0.3010, log3 = 0.4771 and log7 = 0.8451, find log 42.

7.  (a) Rectangle ABCD is similar to rectangle WXYZ. If BC = 9cm, AB = 4cm and WY = 5cm, calculate the length of XY.

    *(Diagram missing)*

    (b) If AC and BD bisect each other at O. Prove that AC = BD. Also prove that ACB = ADB.

8.  A ladder on the ground leans against a vertical wall whose height is 5 metres. The ground distance between the ladder and the wall is 12 metres.

    (i) Draw a diagram to represent this information.
    (ii) Using the diagram in part (i), find the length of the ladder.

    (b) Given that sin A = -5/13, where A is an acute angle, find without using mathematical tables the values of:

    (i) cos A
    (ii) tan A

9.  (a) In a class of 32 students, 18 play golf, 16 play piano and 7 play both golf and piano. Use a formula to find the number of students who play neither golf nor piano.

    (b) A survey was done among students in a certain school in order to find the most popular subject. In this survey each student voted once and the results were as follows:

    | Subject   | Biology | History | Geography | Physics |
    | :-------- | :------ | :------ | :-------- | :------ |
    | Pupils    |         |         |           |         |
