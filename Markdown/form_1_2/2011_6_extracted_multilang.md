## SECTION A

**COMPREHENSION AND SUMMARY (25 MARKS)**

1. Read the following passage carefully and answer the guestions that follow.
All children all over the world have certain things that they need to be given by their parents. These are called Rights of the Child.
These can be divided into four groups.
The first group is Survival Rights. These include the right to live and the right to good health care. Parents and the Government have to ensure that every child’s life is protected and every child is provided with access to health services.
The second group of rights is known as Developmental Rights. These include the right to physical and intellectual development. All children, therefore, have the right to education and play. These rights enable them to grow physically and intellectually.
The third group is known as Protection Rights. These include the rights to protection from being neglected, exploited and tortured.
The fourth group of rights is called Participation Rights. On the basis to these rights, children have the right to make decisions that affect their lives. Hand in hand with the above mentioned rights, all children have responsibilities or duties. These duties include the duty to study hard and the duty to take care of their health; the duty to love and care for others and the duty not to bully others; the duty to take care of their belongings and those of others; the duty not to waste food; the duty to make thoughtful decisions; the duty to help those who have a lot of work to do; the duty to tolerate and respect different views; and the duty to learn from their mistakes.
When we talk about children we usually talk about children from 0
to 18 years. People above 18 years are adults.
