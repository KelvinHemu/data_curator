**SECTION A (60 Marks)**

Answer ALL questions in this section.

1.  Find the rational number in the form $\frac{a}{b}$ where a and b are integers and $b \neq 0$ from the number 0.23.

2.  A rectangle measuring 14cm by 7cm has a semicircle with the side removed as shown in the diagram below. Find the area of the shaded part.

    [Diagram of rectangle with semicircle removed]

3.  Simplify, correct to 3 significant figures:
    (a) 0.000659 + 0.00106 + 0.003407
    (b) 28.243 ÷ 26

4.  Solve the simultaneous equations:
    $3x - 7y = 2$
    $x - 2y = 4$

5.  Make $t$ the subject of the formula in the formula $T = \sqrt{\frac{t}{g}}$.

6.  If shs.600/= amounts to 960/= for 5 years, what is the rate of simple interest per annum?

**SECTION B (40 Marks)**

Answer ALL questions in this section. Show ALL WORKING for each question.

7.  A building has an angle of elevation of 45° from point B. If the distance from the building to point B is 30m, what is the height of the building?

8.  (a) Given that $log_{10}2 = 0.3010$, find $log_{10}360$.
    (b) Use mathematical tables to find $\sqrt{2.345}$.

9.  (a) Construct the locus of a point which is equidistant from two given points L and M.
    (b) In the same drawing, construct the locus of a point which has a distance of 2 cm from line LM.
    (c) How many points belong to both loci?
