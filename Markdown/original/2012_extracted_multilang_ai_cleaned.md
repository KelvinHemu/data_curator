A long time ago, there was a Monkey and his wife who had a garden full of different crops such as beans, peas and cabbages. They also had plenty of yams. Mr. and Mrs. Monkey worked very hard day and night. During the dry season, they watered their garden by using water from the nearby well.

Near their garden lived a Tortoise who was slow and lazy. Mr. Tortoise never did any work. He used to sing his favourite songs all day while Monkey and his wife worked in their garden.

There was a lot of food in the Monkey’s house. The house was so small it could hardly keep all the food from the garden. This was different from Mr. Tortoise’s house since there was no food at all. When Tortoise wanted some food, he got it by telling stories and singing songs. He used to tell children from different homes to take food along when going to his house for the stories and songs.

These children’s parents discovered that Mr. Tortoise was using their children for his survival. So they stopped their children from going there, hence Tortoise suffered from hunger. One day, the Tortoise sent his son to the Monkey’s house to borrow some food and promised to pay him the next day. The Monkey gave the Tortoise some food.

The following day, Monkey went to Tortoise’s house and asked to be paid his money. Tortoise told him not to worry as he would pay him “the next day”. Unfortunately for the Monkey, the next day never came.
