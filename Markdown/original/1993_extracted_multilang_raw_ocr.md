## SECTION A

1. Diagrams A and B represant two cell organelles as seen under the electron microscope.
Diagram B
(a) (i) Identify the two c+! organelles.
(ii) Name the structures numbered 1 - 8,
(b) Without using diagrams, outline the processes taking place in the structures labelled 3 and 8. "
(c) Explain briefly how organelles 1 and 2 are adapted to the functions they perform.

Explain the role of each of the reagents in step 3. Why was it necessary to carry out the procedure for steps 1 & 2
before step 3?
Identify the six’ insects labelled J, K, L, M, N and 0 using common names.
Carefully observe the six insects. List down three features (i), (ii)
and (iii); characteristic of insects, which are shown by each of the
_ Six insects.
Using a table as shown beldw (table 2) compare the six insects on the basis of only the three features you have listed in (b). Copy the table in your answer book but instead of writing (i), (ii) and (iii) in the boxes at the top of each column write your chosen features.

(d) Using only the information in your table, construct a simple dichotomoig]
key” which could be used to separate ‘the six ‘insects.
With the help of a hand lens, iting specimens Sa and Sa:
(a) (1) “Name the class to which ‘specimen $3 belongs.
(ii ) What observable features enable specimen S3 to inhabit terrestrial environments? ‘
(fit) Make a Targe labelled drawing of specimen S3-
(b) (i) Provide the common and scientific names of specimen Sa:
(it) Name the class and phylum to which specimen Sq belong.
(iti ) Name. one other class of the phylum to which. specimen Sa belong and say how the members of this class differ from those in the class fram which Sa was taken.
Cut transverse sections (T.S.) of specimen Ss: ' Select the best section and stain it with phloroglucinol. Mount the section on a microscope slide and observe it under-a microscope.
(a)’ Make a low power drawing (tissue map) of the section. Label the different layers.
(b) (1) Name the tissues which have stained in phloroglucinol.
(ii) What functions do these tissues perform in the plant represented
' by Se? .
(Hii) What features enable the structures which have taken up the stain perform the functions you have mefitioned in bii)? ji https://
