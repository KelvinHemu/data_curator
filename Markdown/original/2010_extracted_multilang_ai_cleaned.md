**SECTION D: COMPREHENSION**

Read the following passage carefully then answer questions 41-50 by writing the letter of the correct answer in your answer sheet.

The weather all over the world in 1997-1998 was very unusual. In Tanzania and other parts of East Africa, there was a lot of rain. Some parts of Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and other neighbouring countries were flooded. Houses were destroyed and many people became homeless. This destruction affected not only homes but also crops and this led to poor health because people did not get enough harvest.

Roads and railways were swept away, so transport and transportation became another problem. Some people were killed. In some parts of East Africa, diseases became a problem. Stagnant water made the breeding of mosquitoes easier and many people were affected by malaria.

Other diseases such as typhoid and cholera were caused by dirty water which was used for domestic activities like cooking, drinking and bathing. The results of this weather change affected people psychologically, socially and economically.

The cause of this unusual weather was El Nino. This is a large current of warm sea water. The name El Nino means “the CHILD.” Peruvian fisherman gave the current of warm sea water this name because it appeared in Christmas time. It does not appear every year. It appears about every 5 years. We can describe El Nino as a current of warm sea water that moves eastward across the Pacific Ocean. The current of sea water is very large.
