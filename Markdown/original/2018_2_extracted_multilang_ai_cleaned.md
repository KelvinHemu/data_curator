**COMPREHENSION**
Answer ALL questions in this section.

Read the passage below and answer the questions.

Khalfan was sitting in his class. He could not help looking out of the window. He had seen something unusual. “Khalfan, pay attention” his teacher said. “Look at the blackboard now!” “Excuse me, teacher”, said Khalfan. “I think there is a problem. I can see smoke coming out of the window over there.”

His teacher, Mrs. Kassim came to the window and looked out. My goodness! You are right Khalfan! There is fire in the staffroom. Now everyone leave the class quietly and stand in the playground. I will inform the teachers and the rest of the school.

Mrs. Kassim immediately spoke to all the teachers and soon all the teachers and the children were standing safely in the playground. Two of the teachers stood near the children to make sure they were safe. Mr. Karim, the head teacher, called 999 on his mobile phone for the firefighters.

In five minutes everyone could hear the siren of the fire engine as it raced towards the school. An ambulance came too, but Mr. Karim later sent it away as no one was hurt. The firefighters and teachers tried to put out the fire, but the fire still burned fiercely. The army was called in to help and some soldiers arrived in five minutes. The two groups pulled long hoses from the three fire engines. They attached them to the water supply and very soon large jets of water poured onto the fire. Thirty minutes later, there was just the smoke and the sight of a badly burn staffroom. “You were lucky it didn’t spread to the other buildings,” said one firefighter.
