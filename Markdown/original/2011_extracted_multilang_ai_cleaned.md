We were living in Dodoma when my father got a job transfer to Arusha. We knew that we would have to move and leave our grandparents. None of the children wanted to leave because we had friends in the village and we did not want to lose them.

When we were told to prepare to leave, we cried because we liked our house and the garden too. Our mother told us that we would like Arusha because it is an interesting place. She told us that there is a snake park with different types of snakes and that we would be visiting the park during holidays. We were excited to hear that.

Our father looked for a lorry and paid the driver to take us and the luggage to Arusha. On Monday, the lorry came. We put our clothes into the bags and packed other things such as tables, chairs, beds and mattresses into the lorry. We then started our journey at 6:00 am and arrived in Arusha that evening.

Even though we were tired from the long journey, we were happy to arrive at a big house which had a beautiful garden with a variety of flowers.
