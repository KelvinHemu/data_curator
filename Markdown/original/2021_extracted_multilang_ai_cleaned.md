**COMPREHENSION**

Answer ALL questions in this section.

Read the following passage and answer the questions.

Mr. Issa is a teacher. He teaches Science subject at Furaha Primary School which is located in Furaha Street. He lives in Pemba at Chakechake District. One day he decided to teach his pupils using a study tour method. He told his pupils that they could learn even out of the classroom. Asha Matata is the class monitor of this class. She studies in standard six. She lives near the school.

Asha Matata had never visited any national park. It was good luck that her teacher arranged a trip to Ngezi Forest. Ngezi Forest is one among the two national parks of Zanzibar which is located in Pemba. Another national park is Jozani Forest which is located in Unguja. The teacher told them that they will go to see many things in their journey like Pemba fox, mgulele trees and even historical sites. At Ngezi Forest they found a guide called Mihayo. The guide welcomed and gave them a short lecture before escorting them through the forest.

Then they started their journey with the guide. First of all he asked them to enter in the office in groups. They were divided into two groups. Inside the office they saw a lot of pictures with different animals such as chameleons, Pemba fox, butterflies and other numerous birds. Each species was in its own natural features. After that Mr. Mihayo told them that when you are visiting this forest, you are not allowed to pick and eat anything in the forest. The guide explained to them about several natural features in Ngezi Forest in all five main sections which were saline grassland, mangrove swamps, dense thicket forest, evergreen bush land and plantations.
