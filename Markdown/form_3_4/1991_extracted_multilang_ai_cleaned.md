This paper consists of three sections, A, B and C.
There are five (5) questions in section A, four (4) questions in section B and four (4) questions in section C.

Attempt ten (10) questions in total: four (4) questions from section A, three (3) from section B and three (3) questions from section C.

This paper consists of 4 printed pages.

    b) What frequencies in the amplitude modulated wave contain intelligence?

2.  a) In Fig. (not provided), the lamp L will illuminate when S is set to one position and not illuminate when S is set to another position. In which position of S will the lamp:

    i) Illuminate?
    ii) Not illuminate?

    Give reasons.

    b) What is the function of R<sub>e</sub>?

    c) Distinguish audio signals from radio signals.

    d) What two factors make up a radio wave?

    e) Name THREE applications of radio waves.

3.  A sine wave has a periodic time of 5Âµs (microseconds) and a peak value of 7mV (millivolts). What is its frequency and r.m.s. value?

4.  a) What is an electronic oscillator?

    b) Name two types of L-C oscillators.

    c) Where is the oscillator positioned in a superhet receiver?

    d) Draw a well-labelled block-diagram of an oscillator.

11. a) Draw a circuit diagram of a simple 6-volt battery charger using a half-wave rectifier. In your diagram include a switch and an ammeter to measure the charging current.

    b) A 12 volts battery has 6 cells. Each cell has an internal resistance of 0.01 ohms. The charger cutout voltage is 12.6 volts. Calculate the initial charging current.

    c) The lead acid battery uses dilute sulphuric acid as the electrolyte. Give the chemical equation for the battery when:

    i) Fully charged
    ii) Completely discharged

12. A 12 volts car battery is supplying two lamps. Each lamp is rated at 30 watts. Calculate:

    i) Current drawn from the battery when the lamps are in parallel.
    ii) Resistance of each lamp.
