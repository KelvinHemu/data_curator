## SECTION A (60 Marks)
Answer all questions in this section.

1.  (a) List the next two numbers in the series $\frac{1}{1 \times 2} + \frac{1}{2 \times 6} + \frac{1}{4 \times 18} + ...$

    (b) (i) Define Divisibility of a number.

        (ii) Use the divisibility rule to show whether 24,679 is divisible by seven.

2.  (a) Use the laws of algebra to simplify the set expression $(A \cup (A \cap B)) \cup A$.

    (b) A group of 150 workers visit Mikumi, Ruaha and Tarangire National Parks. Each worker visits at least one of the three National Parks. 105 workers visit Mikumi, 120 visit Ruaha and 86 visit Tarangire. 50 workers visit Mikumi and Ruaha, 40 visit Mikumi and Tarangire and 30 visit Ruaha and Tarangire. Find the number of workers who visit all the three National Parks.

3.  (a) The polynomial $p(x) = x^3 + kx^2 + tx + 4$ is a perfect cube. Find the values of $k$ and $t$.

    (b) Sketch the graph of the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2 - 6x + 8}$.

4.  (a) Determine the values of $x$ if $|x - 2| > 16$.

5.  (a) Fill in the blanks in the following table: (Table content missing from original text)

    (b) Prove that, in a rectangle the diagonals bisect each other.

6.  The expression $\frac{x}{y} - 4$ varies directly as the square of $\frac{a}{x}$. If the constant of variation is 108 and $a = ax$ when $x = 3, y = 16$, find the values of $a$.

7.  (a) Find the derivative of the function $f(x) = (x^2 + x)(x + 4)$.

8.  Show whether $\frac{\sin \theta + \sin 2\theta}{1 + \cos \theta + \cos 2\theta} = \tan \theta$.

9.  A goat is moving such that it is equidistant from point A (2, 3) and B (2, 7). Determine the locus of the goat.

10. Draw the plan, front and side elevations of a rectangular pyramid.

## SECTION B (40 Marks)
Answer four (4) questions from this section.

11. (a) Calculate the shortest distance of point (6, 5) from the line $y = -\frac{2}{3}x - 2$.

    (b) A circle has a centre at the point (2, 3). If its radius is 5 units, find;

    (i) the equation of the circle in expanded form.

    (ii) the equation of tangent to the circle at the point (5, 7).

12. In an experiment, the candidates were asked to measure the mass of 50 potatoes in grams. The results were recorded as follows;

    11 40 24 31 41 32 23 58 42 37 12 32 66 79 26 75 23 31
    40 33 53 23 31 16 58 38 37 48 63 72 48 23 40 53 25
    18 11 41 29 16 38 32 57 28 64 44 27

    (a) Construct the frequency distribution table.

    (b) Determine;

    (i) The median.

    (ii) The mean.

13. (a) Define tautology of a compound statement.

    (b) Use truth table to determine the validity of the statement $(P \implies Q) \land P \implies Q$.

    (c) Famine does not exist if there is a plenty of food. If famine exists it means there was no rainfall in the previous year. But it rained much in the previous year and famine exists. Therefore there is no plenty of food this year. Write down the compound proposition in symbolic form and simplify it.

14. (a) How many six digit even numbers which are greater than 400,000 can be formed from the digits 1, 4, 3, 7, 5 and 2 without repetitions?
