1.  Find the next three terms in the sequence 3, 10, 16, 16, 36,...
2.  Round each term to 2 significant figures and find the approximate value of M in M = (6.7782 + 2.974) / (7.332 - 2.422).
3.  If U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, A = {1, 2, 3, 4}, B = {2, 4, 6, 8} and C = {3, 4, 5, 6}, find A'.
4.  If α and β are the roots of x² - 2x - 4 = 0, find the values of α² + β².
5.  Use the remainder theorem to find the remainder when P(x) = x³ + 2x² - 4x + 1 is divided by D(x) = x - 3.
6.  Make t the subject of the formula in the equation s = ut - (1/2)gt².
7.  Solve the simultaneous equations xy = 10 and 3x + 2y = 16.
8.  Calculate the size of an exterior angle of a polygon with 12 sides.
9.  How many sides does a polygon have if its sum of interior angles is 1520°?
10. T varies jointly with the square root of x and inversely as the square of y. When x is 9, y is 8 and T is 6, find the equation of the variation.
11. Differentiate y = 2/x - 3x² from the first principle.
12. Eliminate θ from the equations x = a tanθ and y = b cosθ.
13. Define "Supplementary angle".
14. If 2x - 40° and 80° - 2x are supplementary angles, find the value of x.
15. Define "Locus" as it is used in mathematics.
16. Find the equation of the locus of point P(x, y) which is equidistant from point A (0, 1) and the line x - y = 0.

Prompt: Give me exam questions on Additional Mathematics for secondary school students based on sets, sequences, remainders, variations, differentiation, angles, locus, and basic geometry, similar to those found in a Tanzanian CSEE exam.
