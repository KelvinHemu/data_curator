1. Ina biology practical lesson, form four students were provided with sunflower fruits and asked to plan and carry out an experiment to identify the food substances present in them. Suppose you were in that lesson;
(a) What food substances would you have suspected to be present in sunflower fruits?
(b) How would you have prepared the sunflower fruits for the investigation?
(c) What would have been the procedure, results and inferences for your various tests to identify the food substances you have mentioned in (a) above?
Tabulate your answer as in Table 1 below.

Test for Procedure Results Inferences

2. Three different soil samples A, B and C were each shaken up with water in a measuring jar and then left to settle. After some time the different size particles of soil settled in layers. The proportions of the various soil particles in the three samples of soil were determined and the results were as shown in table 2 below.

(a) (i) What was the aim of the experiment ?
(ii) From what type of soils were samples A, B and C taken?
Give reasons

(b) (i) Draw a well labeled diagram to show the arrangement of the various layers formed in the measuring jar when soil sample C was being investigated.
(ii) Briefly explain how one can determine the proportion of each type of particle in a soil sample.

Using common names , identify the fruits represented by Figs. 5-7. Name the edible part(s) of the fruits in Figs. 6 and 7. To which group of fruits does each of the fruits in Figs. 5 — 7 belong?
Which classes of flowering plants do the structures in Figs 8 and 9
represent ?
Distinguish the two classes using only those characteristics observable from the diagrams.
Give the names of the structures labeled 1 and 2 in Figs. 8 and 9.

(a) Name the structures labeled 1 -13. 
(b) Some of the structures you have labeled have functions similar to those od certain structures and organs found in a mammalian body. Identify such structures and compare their functions with those of their counter — parts in mammals. Use a table as shown below (Table 3).
