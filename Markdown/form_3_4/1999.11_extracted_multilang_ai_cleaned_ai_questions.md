14. The probability that Halima will pass Mathematics is 0.4 and that Perpetua will do the same is 0.7. Find the probability that both will pass Mathematics.
15. Determine the equation of the tangent to the circle $x^2 + y^2 - 4x + 6y - 77 = 0$ when the tangent passes through the point of tangency at (5,6).
16. Show that $z^3 + 2z - 3 = (z-1)(z^2 + z + 3)$ and hence find the zeros of $f(z) = z^3 + 2z^2 - 3$.
