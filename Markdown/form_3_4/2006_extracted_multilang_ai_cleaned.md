## SECTION A (60 Marks)

Answer all questions in this section.
All working in each question must be shown clearly.

1. (a) Simplify using basic properties of sets:
    (i) (A' ∩ B') ∪ (A ∩ B) (1 ½ marks)
    (ii) (A - B) ∪ (B - A) (1 ½ marks)

   (b) In a class of 28 pupils, 5 study both chemistry and physics, 7 study both chemistry and biology and none study both physics and biology. The number of pupils who study physics is equal to the number of those who study biology. 16 pupils study chemistry and 2 study none of the three subjects. Find the number of pupils who study:
    (i) biology only
    (ii) chemistry only (3 marks)

2. (a) If p is the statement "x² = 1" and q the statement "x = 1". Write the following statements in symbolic form:
    (i) x² ≠ 1 because x ≠ 1.
    (ii) x = 1 is a necessary and sufficient condition for x² = 1.
    (iii) If x² ≠ 1 then x ≠ 1. (1 ½ marks)

   (b) By using truth tables show that p ⇒ (q ∧ r) ≡ (p ⇒ q) ∧ (p ⇒ r) (4 ½ marks)

3. (a) (i) Calculate the inverse M⁻¹ of the matrix M =  [2  1]
                                                        [3  2] where det M ≠ 0.
    (ii) Find the values of x and y such that M⁻¹ [x] = [1]
                                                 [y]   [1] (3 marks)

   (b) (i) Find the value of k for which the simultaneous equation
        2x - ky = 2
        3x + (k+1)y = 4
        has no solution.
    (ii) By using Cramer’s rule find the values of x and y in (b (i)) above when k = 1. (3 marks)

4. (a) The scores of 40 students in a certain examination were grouped as follows:

   | Class Interval | Frequency |
   |----------------|-----------|
   | 40-44          | 4         |
   | 45-49          | 8         |
   | 50-54          | 10        |
   | 55-59          | 7         |
   | 60-64          | 5         |
   | 65-69          | 4         |
   | 70-74          | 2         |

   Assuming that the two classes bounded by the scores of 40 have equal number of frequencies:
   (i) Prepare a corresponding class frequency table and calculate the mean of the distribution.
