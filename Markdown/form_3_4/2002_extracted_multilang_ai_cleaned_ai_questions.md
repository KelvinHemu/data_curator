4.  If A = {a,b,c}, B= {b, c,d}and C = {c,d,e}, show that AU(B∩C) = (AUB) ∩ (AUC).
5.  If a = (3,5), b = (2,-7) and c = (1, 4) evaluate | 2a - 3b + c |.
6.  If 5cos A = 3 find the values of: (i) sinA (ii) tan A.
7.  If log₂ x = 7, what is log₄ (x)?
8.  Express ½ logₐ x — 7 logₐ y + logₐ Z as a single logarithm.
9.  (a) Prove that the angles in the same segment of a circle are equal.
10. Find the equation of a line through the point (2, 3) perpendicular to the line whose equation is 2y-3x + 1 =0. Determine the slope of the line.
11. The volume of a rectangular box is 1008 cm³. If its length is 14 cm and its breadth is 9 cm, find its height.
12. Solve the inequality (5x - 3) / 2 ≤ 1 and show the solution on a number line.
13. Solve the following system of equations: 2x + y - z = 3, x + 2z = 7 + y, y = x - 5
14. A car travels at 24 m/s for 10 seconds, then decelerates for 4 seconds until it stops. Calculate the deceleration of the car.
15. Draw the following inequalities on the same set of axes: x + y ≥ 5, x + 2y ≤ 11, x + 3y ≤ 15, x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0.

Prompt: Hey, can you generate some math questions for a form four student based on this exam paper? I want questions that cover topics like algebra, geometry, and statistics, similar to what's in the paper.
