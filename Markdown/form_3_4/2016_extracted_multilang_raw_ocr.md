Define tautology of a compound statement.
Use truth table to determine the validity of the statement (P ~ O)~ Prio).
Famine does not exist if there is a plenty of food. If famine exists it means there was no rainfall in the previous year. But it rained much in the previous year and famine exists.
Therefore there is no plenty of food this year. Write down the compound proposition in symbolic form and simplify it.
