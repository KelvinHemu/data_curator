1. Simplify using basic properties of sets: (A‘n B’) vu (An B)
2. In a class of 28 pupils, 5 study both chemistry and physics, 7 study both chemistry and biology and none study both physics and biology. If 16 pupils study chemistry and 2 study none of the three subjects, find the number of pupils who study biology only.
3. If p is the statement “x² = 1” and q the statement “x = 1”. Write the statement “x² ≠ 1 because x ≠ 1” in symbolic form.
4. By using truth tables show that p → (q ^ r) ≡ (p → q) ^ (p → r).
5. Find the value of k for which the simultaneous equation 2x - ky = 2 and 3x + (k+1)y = 4 has no solution.
6. If f(x) = (x-1)/(x+1), show that f(1/x) = -f(x).
7. Find the domain of the function g(x) = √(x² - 4).
8. Solve for θ between 0° and 180° given that 6cos²θ - cosθ - 1 = 0.
9. Evaluate ∫sin²(2x)cos(2x)dx.
10. Find the diameter of the circle x² + y² - 4x + 6y - 12 = 0.
11. Show that the line 4x - 3y - 5 = 0 is a chord of the circle x² + y² + 3x - y - 10 = 0.
12. In a field there are 30 sheep, 15 of which are white and 15 of which are black. If three sheep are selected at random, what is the probability that three of the sheep selected are white?
13. Given the vectors a = 3i + 2j - k and b = i - j - k, determine whether a and b are parallel.
14. Given the vectors a = 3i + 2j - k and b = i - j - k, determine whether a and b are perpendicular.
15. A transformation T assigns to any point (x, y) an image (x', y') according to the rule x' = x - 2y and y' = 0.5x + 3y. Find the equation of the image lines obtained when all points on the lines y = 2x and y = x - 3 undergo the transformation T.
16. Find the coordinates of the turning points of the curve y = (2x - 3)(x² + 6) and determine the nature of each point.

Prompt: Can you give me some questions on additional mathematics from this past paper? I want questions that cover the different topics in the paper and vary in difficulty.
