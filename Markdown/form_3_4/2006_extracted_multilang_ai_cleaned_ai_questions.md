1.  Simplify (A' ∩ B') ∪ (A ∩ B) using basic properties of sets.
2.  Simplify (A - B) ∪ (B - A) using basic properties of sets.
3.  In a class of 28 pupils, 5 study both chemistry and physics, 7 study both chemistry and biology and none study both physics and biology. The number of pupils who study physics is equal to the number of those who study biology. 16 pupils study chemistry and 2 study none of the three subjects. Find the number of pupils who study biology only.

5.  If p is the statement "x² = 1" and q the statement "x = 1", write the statement "x² ≠ 1 because x ≠ 1" in symbolic form.
6.  If p is the statement "x² = 1" and q the statement "x = 1", write the statement "x = 1 is a necessary and sufficient condition for x² = 1" in symbolic form.
7.  If p is the statement "x² = 1" and q the statement "x = 1", write the statement "If x² ≠ 1 then x ≠ 1" in symbolic form.
8.  By using truth tables show that p ⇒ (q ∧ r) ≡ (p ⇒ q) ∧ (p ⇒ r).
9.  Calculate the inverse M⁻¹ of the matrix M =  [2  1]
                                                        [3  2] where det M ≠ 0.
10. Find the values of x and y such that M⁻¹ [x] = [1]
                                                 [y]   [1] , where M⁻¹ is the inverse of M =  [2  1]

11. Find the value of k for which the simultaneous equation 2x - ky = 2 and 3x + (k+1)y = 4 has no solution.
12. By using Cramer’s rule find the values of x and y in 2x - ky = 2 and 3x + (k+1)y = 4 when k = 1.
13. If f(x) = (x - 1) / (x + 1), show that f(1/x) = -f(x).
14. Find the domain of the function g(x) = √(x + 1) / (x - 2).
