**PASSAGE**

The villagers of Rutuba used to gather at Mwenyeheri's shop in order to watch news on TV.
One day, it was announced that rain season will last for only seven weeks. After that the whole area will experience severe drought. The farmers were advised to prepare their farms early for cultivation.
Meka, Matata, Haiba and some other villagers said that it had never been dry in that area. Therefore, they ignored the news. Only one villager, who was called Mwenge, believed what was said. He prepared the farm early and planted the short term seeds which took two months to harvest.
The rains came. It rained for seven weeks as it was announced. This short rain season was followed by several months of severe drought. The villagers started to believe what was announced on TV. Mwenge harvested a lot of crops in two months’ time, but other villagers did not harvest anything because they had ignored the news. So, they were starving and struggling to buy food from Mwenge.
