Scientists keep asking themselves whether coffee drinking is harmful or not. Well, according to doctors, drinking little coffee does no danger at all. But people who drink too much coffee can experience health problems. The heart beats speed up, breathing becomes difficult and blood pressure goes up. Too much coffee drinking may result into headache and stomach irritation, especially when the coffee drinker swallows the coffee before eating enough food.

However, coffee drinking helps to improve doing well in sports and manual work. People who live in cold areas drink coffee to make their bodies warm. Coffee growers should not feel bad for the disadvantages caused by coffee drinking. After all, there are many countries in the world whose economy depends upon coffee. The important point is that every person should know his or her body if it accepts coffee or not. If it does not, it is better to avoid it all together.
