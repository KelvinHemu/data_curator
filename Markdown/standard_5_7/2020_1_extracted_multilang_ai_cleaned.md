**COMPREHENSION**

Answer ALL questions in this section.

Read the following passage and answer the questions.

Mr. Miraji is the head teacher of Mtoni Primary School. Yesterday he invited Mr. Jaku to come to his school to talk to the pupils about the effects of drug abuse. Mr. Jaku is a doctor. He works at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital. He has been working as a doctor for ten years. Mr. Jaku talked to the standard six pupils. He told them that there are different kinds of drug abuse such as alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, heroin and others.

Mr. Jaku said many people start using drugs just because their friends do and the problem is that, majority of them do not know the effects of these drugs.

He told them if a person tries to use marijuana, he/she will damage the brain and sometimes the capacity of thinking can be reduced.

Also Mr. Jaku said many people who use cocaine and heroin their bodies become very weak compared to non users. This is because they dislike eating food due to loosing appetite. Therefore, they just like eating snacks and juice.

Apart from that Mr. Jaku told the pupils, for the people who drink alcohol usually destroy their respect because they act bad behavior to the people around them regardless if they are relatives or friends. It is believed that they become unconscious at that moment.

The pupils were sitting in the hall and they were very quiet listening to Mr. Jaku attentively. He continued talking to the pupils and he said that using drugs is very dangerous because you can spoil yourself, your life as well as your family.

Many people have been divorced with their spouses, others they have been taken to jail and also mental hospital. The main victims of this problem are youths.

Mr. Jaku then asked the pupils “Do you like to have a good life or you want to spoil your life?” “We want to have good life” the pupils replied. So if that is true, you should work hard in your lessons and avoid using any kind of drugs. Also you should be very careful on choosing good friends with good manners. Mr. Miraji concluded by saying that “Be smart, don’t start”.
