Lilato had a dream. He dreamt that someone gave him an egg. He was very happy and started wondering what to do with it. He thought of either eating it or keeping it in his pocket so that it would be warm and finally hatch and become a chick.
He thought of how this chick would grow into a hen and lay more eggs which will also hatch into more chickens. He would then sell some of those chickens and become a rich man. After getting a lot of money, Lilato thought of building an iron roofed house with glass windows. It would be a beautiful and big house.
