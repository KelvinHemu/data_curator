One day, Chausiku fell sick. She could not go to school. Her mother took her to hospital. At the hospital, Chausiku’s mother wanted to see the doctor but the nurse told her that the doctor was busy. Therefore, she had to wait.

Chausiku started vomiting. She was sweating too. Her body temperature was high. She had a fever. Her mother could not wait any longer. She went back to the nurse to ask for the doctor.

She spoke politely, “Nurse, could you please request the doctor to attend Chausiku?” The nurse left for a while then returned and reported that the doctor is still busy with other patients.

Chausiku’s mother requested for her daughter to be attended by another doctor. Therefore, the nurse referred Chausiku to another doctor. She was taken to the Laboratory for further diagnosis.

The results revealed that Chausiku was suffering from malaria.

The doctor asked Chausiku if she has a habit of using the mosquito net. Chausiku said that she is rarely using the mosquito net. The doctor advised Chausiku to use mosquito net always in order to protect herself from getting malaria. Chausiku was given medicine and returned home with her mother.
