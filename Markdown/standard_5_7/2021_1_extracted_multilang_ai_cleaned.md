**PASSAGE:**

Everybody is supposed to behave well in any given circumstances. The act of conducting and presenting yourself with respect and honour is what is called manners.

Let us talk about Sheila, a clever girl from Mwenge Primary School. She is a good example of a pupil with good manners. When she has a problem, she seeks help from her teachers. That happens all the time. If she wants to go to the washroom or borrow something, she will say, “Please sir, may I go?” or “Please madam, may I borrow a pen from Ashura?” When she is given permission to do what she has asked for, she would say, “Thank you sir” or “Thank you madam.”

When she borrows something from her fellow pupil, she uses it and carefully returns it and says, “Thank you very much for your kindness.” By behaving this way, she is liked by her teachers, her fellow pupils and everyone at home including her neighbours.
